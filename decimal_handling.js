**Let's see why `0.1 + 0.2` is not equal to `0.3` in JavaScript or Python.**

- The reason why 0.1 + 0.2 is not equal to 0.3 in JavaScript or Python (and in many other programming languages) is due
  to
  how floating-point numbers are represented and stored in these languages.

- Both JavaScript and Python, like many other programming languages, use the IEEE 754 standard for representing
  floating-point numbers. In this representation, numbers are stored in binary format, and not all decimal numbers can
  be
  accurately represented in binary. This can lead to small precision errors when performing arithmetic operations with
  floating-point numbers.

- The reason for this discrepancy lies in how floating-point numbers are represented in these programming languages.
  Both
  JavaScript and Python (like many other languages) use the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point representation, which
  stores numbers in binary format.

- In base 10 (decimal), the fraction 0.1 can be precisely represented: one-tenth or 1/10. However, when converted to
  binary (base 2), the fraction 0.1 becomes a repeating binary fraction:
  0.0001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011... and so on. Similarly, 0.2 in binary is
  0.001100110011001100110011001100110011001100110011... and so on.

- When these binary representations are added together, the result is a binary approximation of 0.3, but not exactly
  0.3.
  The actual result is a binary floating-point number slightly larger than 0.3. When this result is converted back to
  decimal for display, you see 0.30000000000000004 (in JavaScript or Python).

Let's illustrate this in JavaScript:

```typescript
console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // Output: 0.30000000000000004
```

And Python:

```python
print(0.1 + 0.2)  # Output: 0.30000000000000004
```

- The issue is not specific to JavaScript or Python; it's a limitation of how floating-point numbers are represented in
  binary. Many programming languages will exhibit similar behavior.

- To handle such precision-critical operations, especially when dealing with currency or financial calculations, it is
  advisable to use specialized decimal libraries like Python's decimal module, which provides the Decimal data type for
  accurate decimal arithmetic. In JavaScript, you can use libraries like decimal.js or big.js to achieve similar
  precision. These libraries avoid the binary representation issues and perform calculations more accurately for decimal
  numbers.
